Data Structures
- A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be easily accessed and manipulated.
Particularly in C, it's a way of using your computer's memory to solve problems in effective and interesting ways.

Abstract Data Types
Queues
 - FIFO (First In First Out)
 enqeueue
 dequeue
Stacks
 - LIFO (Last In First Out)
 push
 pop

Linked Lists
- A linked list is a collection of nodes that are connected to one another. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node.
Assuming there's a node struct with a value and a pointer to the next node:
typedef struct node {
    int value;
    struct node *next;
} node

node *n = malloc(sizeof(node)); // allocate memory for a node
(*n).number = 42; // access the value field of the node
The above can also be written as 
n -> number = 42;
n -> next = NULL;

Trees
- A tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a value and zero or more children.

Dictionaries
- A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a value.
