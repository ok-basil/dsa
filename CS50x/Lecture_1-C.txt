C
-  #include<stdio.h> at the top of your program is referred to as the header file.
- stdio.h is a library

Format codes
%s - string
%i - integer 
%f - float
%c - character
%li - long integer

Integer overflow
- Integer data type is not big enough to hold the value. This essentially happens when there isn't enough memory to store the value.

Truncation
- Happens when integers are used to carry out operations that should be done with floats.

Type Casting
- Casting is the process of converting one data type to another.

Floating-point imprecision
- The difference between the actual value and the value stored in the computer's memory is known as floating-point imprecision. This is a result of not being able to represent every possible value with a finite number of bits.

Compiling
- Compiling is the process of converting code written in a programming language into a format that can be executed by a computer. It's an amalgamation of four main steps.
- Preprocessing: converts the called libraries at the top into their equivalents
- Compiling: converts the source code into assembly code
- Asssembling: converts the assembly code into machine code
- Linking: links the various separate files (the libraries and source code) together and then creates an executable file.

NUL is the zero byte that represents the end of a string.
