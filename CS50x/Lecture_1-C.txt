Integer overflow
- Integer data type is not big enough to hold the value. This essentially happens when there isn't enough memory to store the value.

Truncation
- Happens when integers are used to carry out operations that should be done with floats.

Type Casting
- Casting is the process of converting one data type to another.

Floating-point imprecision
- The difference between the actual value and the value stored in the computer's memory is known as floating-point imprecision. This is a result of not being able to represent every possible value with a finite number of bits.
